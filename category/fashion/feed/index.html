										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Look no further than the pouch as your evening bag of choice this fall. It’s the <em>“woke up like this”</em> of accessories—superchic but beautiful. Take an <a href="http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/designer/etro">Etro</a> silk embroidered pouch or even a rich velvet version by <a href="http://www.vogue.com/tag/designer/ralph-lauren/">Ralph Lauren</a> on the town. Go a little crazy, even, and treat yourself to <strong>The Row</strong>’s mink fur medicine cross-body.</p>

<p>Shop all of the fleeces, puffers, and hoodies fashion editors are buying now in the slideshow above. And never fear, the pouch is more versatile than it may appear—it pairs perfectly with everything from light-wash jeans and a T-shirt and slides, to a slinky little cocktail dress, to something even as dressy as black tie.</p>

<p>On one hand, a basic coat often keeps you warmer than its fashion-y cousin (especially in February, when we’re schlepping through a blizzard at <em>Fashion Week</em>), but it also lets you wear something super-loud underneath, like a neon sweater or a wildly impractical party dress.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro">There’s a smart way to approach the herringbone and power suiting combination that, well, <em>suits</em> every kind of woman. Go completely classic and traditional in a blazer and straight-leg trousers.</p>
<p>Much has been written about “statement outerwear,” from blush peacoats to rainbow-striped furs and retro shearlings. The trend certainly isn’t going anywhere—we can <a href="http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2017-ready-to-wear/gucci/slideshow/collection#11">thank Gucci for that</a>—but there’s something to be said for a simple, decidedly unstylish coat.</p>

<p>The unlikely pairing seems tailor-made for a woman who looks incredibly chic yet not overly corporate, a woman who is confident and powerful and ready to take on anything. Shop all of the fleeces, puffers, and hoodies Vogue.com editors are buying now in the slideshow above.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro">In Tokyo, what you wear to the office is in many ways a group effort, and Japan’s community of professionals dress in hive mind uniformity; the hordes of suited salarymen boarding the Chuo Line each morning is testament to that.</p>
<p>Dressed Undressed’s Spring collection riffed on the city’s community of hard workers and showed formal officewear that was reappropriated for the street, undoing a little of that desk-chained discipline.</p>

<a href='https://kazufu.github.io/_kazufu_/noah-demo-4/'><img width="1024" height="678" src="https://kazufu.github.io/_kazufu_/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/noah-demo-4.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>

<p>Whether a salaryman suit or a schoolgirl’s sailor top, professional uniforms are crucial in Tokyo, explained<strong> Takeshi Kitazawa</strong>, who founded the brand with codesigner <strong>Emiko Sato</strong> in 2009. “I wanted to bend the rules a little,” Kitazawa said, the rules in this case being the many morals and manners expected in Japanese society.</p>
<p>Although some pieces were more direct in the revamped workwear approach (a double-breasted black trenchcoat had an entire sleeve sliced off), the finer, wearable tweaks were more seductive: Billowing culottes were slit just above the knee, and silk, black lace–trimmed chemises peeked out from oversize office shirts in cornflower blue.<span style="font-weight: 400;">Irina Kravchenko and Steph Smith photographed by Sebastian Kim for Vogue Russia, March 2016</span></p>

<p>Whether it’s those vintage-inspired blue jeans, a trompe l’oeil print, or a winter-white flare that you’re after, read about all seven of our favorite new labels in the slideshow above. If you weren’t already in the market for a new pair of jeans, you’ll likely want one—or three—now. It wasn’t so long ago that the idea of seeing jeans on the runway would have provided a serious shock.</p>

<p>Denim was strictly reserved for the weekend, not to be confused with haute ready-to-wear—but that all changed within the space of a few years. This season alone there were denim trench coats, denim dresses, and no shortage of statement jeans. haring outfit-of-the-day selfies on Instagram, collecting the latest kicks, and showing up to events in everything from Kith streetwear to perfectly tailored tuxedos, the class of 2016 is already making its mark.</p>

<blockquote><p>“The typical hard-shell miniature doesn’t feel modern right now”</p></blockquote>
<p>Forgo the usual bouquet this fall for a hostess gift that’s a bit more unique and of the moment. Play up the flavors of fall with thoughtfully chosen wine, desserts, and even a lovely seasonal candle.If you’re planning to spend a weekend away at a friend’s home, bring a more substantial gift to show your gratitude for their hospitality.</p>
