										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro">Interior design can be a mystery to those who are not professionals. And of course, every designer has their own set of rules and ideas gleaned over decades of work.</p>
<p>When setting out to furnish your first home, there seems to be a never-ending list of items you need to buy that you didn’t know you needed<em> (i.e., a paper towel holder, towel hooks, et cetera)</em>. Before getting lost in the minutiae, outline some essentials that will make your new home feel complete, like a sofa or a great comforter. Larger items like a couch or bed frame are often more expensive, but if you spend a bit more now, you’ll probably avoid having to replace it in just a few years.</p>
<blockquote><p>In interior design, the happy marriage between architecture and decorating, the way you look at things makes a big difference between a pleasant solution and a transformative one.</p></blockquote>
<p>Color is another element that deserves a second look. When designing for kids or pets, I think white upholstery is best. That sounds counterintuitive, but if you think about it, white can be bleached and colors can’t; white tells you when it has to be cleaned. <strong>So why use fabrics that disguise dirt?</strong></p>

<p>Proportion is the relationship of parts to a whole—for example, the legs of a chair to its back. Scale is also the relationship of that chair to the room in which it sits. A designer should not be afraid to plant large pieces of furniture in a small room.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro">Fall’s cooler temperatures mean it’s time to swap out your summer-weight bedding for the heavy stuff, but if fall also means the start of allergy season, it might be time to change your bedding for a whole different reason.</p>
<p class="intro"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-271" src="https://kazufu.github.io/_kazufu_/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/noah-demo-2.jpg" alt="2fba5b2dedf3b827400b5fc30ad78e18" width="280" height="420" /></p>
<p>After a recent trip to the allergist alerted me to the fact that my recent health woes were due to environmental allergens, I quickly realized that this season’s bedroom refresh would have to be a bit more drastic than in years past.</p>
<p>Wreaths are usually associated with Christmas and might make people think of overly craft-y, slightly tacky creations. But the true prime time for front door wreath hanging is arguably the fall. A welcoming garland ushers in the cozy sentiments of the season, and the creative varieties are seemingly endless.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The garden is the most beautiful kind of entertainment.”</p>
<p>Jean Mus</p></blockquote>
<p>Forgo the usual bouquet this fall for a hostess gift that’s a bit more unique and of the moment. Play up the flavors of fall with thoughtfully chosen wine, desserts, and even a lovely seasonal candle. If you’re planning to spend a weekend away at a friend’s home, bring a more substantial gift to show your gratitude for their hospitality.</p>
<p>A fascinating new book, written by Lucinda Hawksley, examines this very question—but with an emphasis on one particular item: wallpaper. In the early to mid-19th century, many European countries produced wallpaper laced with arsenic.</p>

<h4>Fall thorugh the spring</h4>
<p>Forgo the usual bouquet this fall for a hostess gift that’s a bit more unique and of the moment. Play up the flavors of fall with thoughtfully chosen wine, desserts, and even a lovely seasonal candle.  After a recent trip to the allergist alerted me to the fact that my recent health woes were due to environmental allergens, I quickly realized that this season’s bedroom refresh would have to be a bit more drastic than in years past.</p>
<p>Much has been written about “statement outerwear,” from blush peacoats to rainbow-striped furs and retro shearlings. Wreaths are usually associated with Christmas and might make people think of overly craft-y, slightly tacky creations.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you haven’t done so already, it’s time to rid your home of summery linens and seashells in favor of richer, warmer hues and textures. Not only will your home feel more seasonally appropriate, but it will also become a cozy haven as the colder weather approaches. While swapping out your white linens for a warmer comforter and cashmere throw are fairly obvious, creating the perfect reading nook or prepping your guest bedroom for the holidays may not be.</p>
