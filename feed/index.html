										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ave you ever walked down East Second Street? If the answer is yes, you’ve likely been struck by the series of enchanting, gem-like shops known collectively as the John Derian Company. Carrying textiles, furniture, and many magical baubles, the stores’ most renowned wares are undoubtedly the decoupage pieces—made by Derian himself.</p>
<p>And now, after almost three decades’ worth of production, <a href="https://www.workman.com/products/john-derian-picture-book" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a book</a> detailing the prints behind these pieces is coming out next week. With vivid reproductions—and a foreword by <em>Vogue</em> Editor in Chief <a href="http://www.vogue.com/tag/celebrity/anna-wintour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anna Wintour</a>—it is truly a must-read. But what we really wanted to know after our own perusal was technical nitty-gritty—decoupage 101, from where to shop for images to business words of wisdom. Here, John Derian’s tips of the trade.</p>
<h4><strong> </strong>Finding Prints</h4>
<p>They’re mostly 18th- and 19th-century prints from dealers and antique bookshops like The Old Print Shop on Lexington Avenue—but 99 percent of the images come from instructive books. The funny, naive, and vintage ephemera are from a couple other more specific dealers and one flea market in New York.</p>

<p>And now, after almost three decades’ worth of production, <a href="https://www.workman.com/products/john-derian-picture-book" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a book</a> detailing the prints behind these pieces is coming out next week.

But what we really wanted to know after our own perusal was technical nitty-gritty—decoupage 101, from where to shop for images to business words of wisdom. Here, John Derian’s tips of the trade:</p>
<h4>The Process Behind</h4>
<p>I collect prints throughout the year and then create a biannual collection for the four shows I do—two in New York and two in Paris. I decide what I think will best show the beauty of the images I find: Will they work better larger or smaller? Would just a detail be enough? Then I mock up the pieces in my studio, and the team at my workshop piece it all together and I see what works.</p>
<p>Most of the trays are a single layer of paper, with glue evenly applied on the surface of the image. Clear glass-blown trays from Virginia get placed on top, and the glue is moved around, leaving an even, cloudy film that dries clear. Then they get finished—painted with a gold border along the edges and felted.</p>

<p>“The typical hard-shell miniature doesn’t feel modern right now,” says Vogue.com Market Editor Chelsea Zalopany, adding that she usually veers more toward a “satin pochette or a vintage coin purse,” possibly the key to achieving this <a href="http://www.vogue.com/tag/model/kate-moss">Kate Moss</a>–in-the-’90s-meets-2016 look. And never fear, the pouch is more versatile than it may appear—it pairs perfectly with everything from light-wash jeans and a T-shirt and slides, to a slinky little cocktail dress, to something even as dressy as black tie.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sisters <strong>Lily</strong> and <strong>Hopie Stockman</strong> are in the business of teaching others how to work with their hands. Aside from creating their own eye-catching, geometric printed textiles through their label <a href="http://www.blockshoptextiles.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Block Shop</a>, the Stockmans also host a series of printing workshops at an enviable offsite studio and home in <em>Joshua Tree, California</em>. In a serene, well-appointed setting, visitors come to learn about the art of block printing, a craft that these sisters fell in love with back in 2010 after Lily met a master dyer in <em>Jaipur</em> while she was in art school there studying painting.</p>
<p>

<p>She worked with the craftsman, <strong>Vijendra (Viju) Chhipa</strong>, on several pieces she then sent over to her sister who was back home. Hopie was so moved by the paintings that she traveled to meet <strong>Viju</strong> herself several months later and from there, they formed a textile business that would see all of its materials printed by <strong>Viju</strong> and his fellow local artisans.</p>
<p>Wreaths are usually associated with Christmas and might make people think of overly craft-y, slightly tacky creations. But the true prime time for front door wreath hanging is arguably the fall. A welcoming garland ushers in the cozy sentiments of the season, and the creative varieties are seemingly endless.<span style="font-weight: 400;">At home with photographer Penny Lane in <a href="http://thedesignfiles.net/2015/03/penny-lane/">The Design Files</a></span></p>

<p>On one hand, a basic coat often keeps you warmer than its fashion-y cousin (especially in February, when we’re schlepping through a blizzard at <em>Fashion Week</em>), but it also lets you wear something super-loud underneath, like a neon sweater or a wildly impractical party dress.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro">Interior design can be a mystery to those who are not professionals. And of course, every designer has their own set of rules and ideas gleaned over decades of work.</p>
<p>When setting out to furnish your first home, there seems to be a never-ending list of items you need to buy that you didn’t know you needed<em> (i.e., a paper towel holder, towel hooks, et cetera)</em>. Before getting lost in the minutiae, outline some essentials that will make your new home feel complete, like a sofa or a great comforter. Larger items like a couch or bed frame are often more expensive, but if you spend a bit more now, you’ll probably avoid having to replace it in just a few years.</p>
<blockquote><p>In interior design, the happy marriage between architecture and decorating, the way you look at things makes a big difference between a pleasant solution and a transformative one.</p></blockquote>
<p>Color is another element that deserves a second look. When designing for kids or pets, I think white upholstery is best. That sounds counterintuitive, but if you think about it, white can be bleached and colors can’t; white tells you when it has to be cleaned. <strong>So why use fabrics that disguise dirt?</strong></p>
<p>
<a href='https://kazufu.github.io/_kazufu_/noah-demo-4/'><img width="1024" height="678" src="https://kazufu.github.io/_kazufu_/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/noah-demo-4.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>
<a href='https://kazufu.github.io/_kazufu_/noah-demo-1/'><img width="1024" height="768" src="https://kazufu.github.io/_kazufu_/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/noah-demo-1.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>
</p>
<p>Proportion is the relationship of parts to a whole—for example, the legs of a chair to its back. Scale is also the relationship of that chair to the room in which it sits. A designer should not be afraid to plant large pieces of furniture in a small room.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro">Fall’s cooler temperatures mean it’s time to swap out your summer-weight bedding for the heavy stuff, but if fall also means the start of allergy season, it might be time to change your bedding for a whole different reason.</p>

<p>After a recent trip to the allergist alerted me to the fact that my recent health woes were due to environmental allergens, I quickly realized that this season’s bedroom refresh would have to be a bit more drastic than in years past.</p>
<p>Wreaths are usually associated with Christmas and might make people think of overly craft-y, slightly tacky creations. But the true prime time for front door wreath hanging is arguably the fall. A welcoming garland ushers in the cozy sentiments of the season, and the creative varieties are seemingly endless.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The garden is the most beautiful kind of entertainment.”</p>
<p>Jean Mus</p></blockquote>
<p>Forgo the usual bouquet this fall for a hostess gift that’s a bit more unique and of the moment. Play up the flavors of fall with thoughtfully chosen wine, desserts, and even a lovely seasonal candle. If you’re planning to spend a weekend away at a friend’s home, bring a more substantial gift to show your gratitude for their hospitality.</p>
<p>A fascinating new book, written by Lucinda Hawksley, examines this very question—but with an emphasis on one particular item: wallpaper. In the early to mid-19th century, many European countries produced wallpaper laced with arsenic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro">There’s a smart way to approach the herringbone and power suiting combination that, well, <em>suits</em> every kind of woman. Go completely classic and traditional in a blazer and straight-leg trousers.</p>
<p>Much has been written about “statement outerwear,” from blush peacoats to rainbow-striped furs and retro shearlings. The trend certainly isn’t going anywhere—we can <a href="http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2017-ready-to-wear/gucci/slideshow/collection#11">thank Gucci for that</a>—but there’s something to be said for a simple, decidedly unstylish coat.</p>

<p>The unlikely pairing seems tailor-made for a woman who looks incredibly chic yet not overly corporate, a woman who is confident and powerful and ready to take on anything. Shop all of the fleeces, puffers, and hoodies Vogue.com editors are buying now in the slideshow above.</p>
<blockquote><p>Chalk it up to the Vetements effect, but we’re on the hunt for plain parkas, quilted puffers, and rain jackets that are completely lacking in bells or whistles.</p></blockquote>
<p>On one hand, a basic coat often keeps you warmer than its fashion-y cousin (especially in February, when we’re schlepping through a blizzard at Fashion Week), but it also lets you wear something super-loud underneath, like a neon sweater or a wildly impractical party dress. Shop all of the fleeces, puffers, and hoodies Vogue.com editors are buying now in the slideshow above.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Given the current political situation, “stayin’ alive,” or rather staying sane, is a complicated proposition; it necessitates some life, and dress, hacks. The unlikely pairing seems tailor-made for a woman who looks incredibly chic yet not overly corporate, a woman who is confident and powerful and ready to take on anything.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro">In Tokyo, what you wear to the office is in many ways a group effort, and Japan’s community of professionals dress in hive mind uniformity; the hordes of suited salarymen boarding the Chuo Line each morning is testament to that.</p>
<p>Dressed Undressed’s Spring collection riffed on the city’s community of hard workers and showed formal officewear that was reappropriated for the street, undoing a little of that desk-chained discipline.</p>

<p>Whether a salaryman suit or a schoolgirl’s sailor top, professional uniforms are crucial in Tokyo, explained<strong> Takeshi Kitazawa</strong>, who founded the brand with codesigner <strong>Emiko Sato</strong> in 2009. “I wanted to bend the rules a little,” Kitazawa said, the rules in this case being the many morals and manners expected in Japanese society.</p>
<p>Although some pieces were more direct in the revamped workwear approach (a double-breasted black trenchcoat had an entire sleeve sliced off), the finer, wearable tweaks were more seductive: Billowing culottes were slit just above the knee, and silk, black lace–trimmed chemises peeked out from oversize office shirts in cornflower blue.<span style="font-weight: 400;">Irina Kravchenko and Steph Smith photographed by Sebastian Kim for Vogue Russia, March 2016</span></p>
