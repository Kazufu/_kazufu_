		<p>Welcome to <strong>image alignment!</strong> The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let’s get started.</p>
<h3>Large Images – No Captions</h3>
<p>The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around a <strong>left aligned </strong>image. As you can see there should be some space above, below, and to the left of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-261 size-full alignleft" src="http://placehold.it/1400x900/000000/FFFFFF?text=1400x900+align:%20left" width="1400" height="900"></p>
<p>Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speaklike you words. As you can see there should be some space above, below, and to the left of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words.</p>
<p>Don’t let anyone else tell you differently. In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the left aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah… Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we’ll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition.</p>

<p>And now we’re going to shift things to the<strong> center align</strong>. Again, there should be  plenty of room above, below, and to the right of the image. Just look at him there… Hey guy! Way to rock that left side. I don’t care what the right aligned image says, you look great:</p>
