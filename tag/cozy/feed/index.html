										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Look no further than the pouch as your evening bag of choice this fall. It’s the “woke up like this” of accessories—superchic but beautiful. Take an <a href="http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/designer/etro">Etro</a> silk embroidered pouch or even a rich velvet version by <a href="http://www.vogue.com/tag/designer/ralph-lauren/">Ralph Lauren</a> on the town. Go a little crazy, even, and treat yourself to The Row’s mink fur medicine cross-body.</p>

<p>“The typical hard-shell miniature doesn’t feel modern right now,” says Vogue.com Market Editor Chelsea Zalopany, adding that she usually veers more toward a “satin pochette or a vintage coin purse,” possibly the key to achieving this <a href="http://www.vogue.com/tag/model/kate-moss">Kate Moss</a>–in-the-’90s-meets-2016 look. And never fear, the pouch is more versatile than it may appear—it pairs perfectly with everything from light-wash jeans and a T-shirt and slides, to a slinky little cocktail dress, to something even as dressy as black tie.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro">Interior design can be a mystery to those who are not professionals. And of course, every designer has their own set of rules and ideas gleaned over decades of work.</p>
<p>When setting out to furnish your first home, there seems to be a never-ending list of items you need to buy that you didn’t know you needed<em> (i.e., a paper towel holder, towel hooks, et cetera)</em>. Before getting lost in the minutiae, outline some essentials that will make your new home feel complete, like a sofa or a great comforter. Larger items like a couch or bed frame are often more expensive, but if you spend a bit more now, you’ll probably avoid having to replace it in just a few years.</p>
<blockquote><p>In interior design, the happy marriage between architecture and decorating, the way you look at things makes a big difference between a pleasant solution and a transformative one.</p></blockquote>
<p>Color is another element that deserves a second look. When designing for kids or pets, I think white upholstery is best. That sounds counterintuitive, but if you think about it, white can be bleached and colors can’t; white tells you when it has to be cleaned. <strong>So why use fabrics that disguise dirt?</strong></p>

<a href='https://kazufu.github.io/_kazufu_/noah-demo-4/'><img width="1024" height="678" src="https://kazufu.github.io/_kazufu_/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/noah-demo-4.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>
<a href='https://kazufu.github.io/_kazufu_/noah-demo-1/'><img width="1024" height="768" src="https://kazufu.github.io/_kazufu_/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/noah-demo-1.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>

<p>Proportion is the relationship of parts to a whole—for example, the legs of a chair to its back. Scale is also the relationship of that chair to the room in which it sits. A designer should not be afraid to plant large pieces of furniture in a small room.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro">In Tokyo, what you wear to the office is in many ways a group effort, and Japan’s community of professionals dress in hive mind uniformity; the hordes of suited salarymen boarding the Chuo Line each morning is testament to that.</p>
<p>Dressed Undressed’s Spring collection riffed on the city’s community of hard workers and showed formal officewear that was reappropriated for the street, undoing a little of that desk-chained discipline.</p>

<a href='https://kazufu.github.io/_kazufu_/noah-demo-4/'><img width="1024" height="678" src="https://kazufu.github.io/_kazufu_/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/noah-demo-4.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>

<p>Whether a salaryman suit or a schoolgirl’s sailor top, professional uniforms are crucial in Tokyo, explained<strong> Takeshi Kitazawa</strong>, who founded the brand with codesigner <strong>Emiko Sato</strong> in 2009. “I wanted to bend the rules a little,” Kitazawa said, the rules in this case being the many morals and manners expected in Japanese society.</p>
<p>Although some pieces were more direct in the revamped workwear approach (a double-breasted black trenchcoat had an entire sleeve sliced off), the finer, wearable tweaks were more seductive: Billowing culottes were slit just above the knee, and silk, black lace–trimmed chemises peeked out from oversize office shirts in cornflower blue.<span style="font-weight: 400;">Irina Kravchenko and Steph Smith photographed by Sebastian Kim for Vogue Russia, March 2016</span></p>
